  "position_offset_overview_and_description": "<h4>Positional Adjustments Overview</h4><block>The OT-2 provides two types of positional adjustments. The first type is robot calibration: Deck calibration, Tip Length calibration and Pipette Offset calibration. These calibrations ensure the OT-2 moves to the expected positions on the deck. It is essential to have good robot calibration before creating any labware offsets and running protocols.</block>",

  "creating_labware_offset_data": "<h4>Creating Labware Offset Data During Labware Position Check</h4><block>Labware Position Check is a recommended workflow that helps you verify the position of every labware on the deck for an added degree of precision in your protocol. When you check a labware, the OT-2’s pipette nozzle or attached tip will stop at the center of the A1 well. If the pipette nozzle or tip is not centered, you can reveal the OT-2’s jog controls to make an adjustment. This Labware Offset will be applied to the entire labware. Offset data is measured to the nearest 1/10th mm and can be made in the X, Y and/or Z directions.</block>",
  "labware_offset_data_info": "Opentrons offers a second type of positional adjustment, a Labware Offset. Labware Offsets are intended to account for small, real-world variances in the overall position of the labware on an OT-2’s deck. A Labware Offset is unique to a specific combination of the following during a run: labware, module (if present), deck slot, protocol and OT-2. ",
