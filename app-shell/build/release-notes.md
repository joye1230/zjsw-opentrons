# Opentrons App Changes in 6.0.0

Welcome to the v6.0.0 release of the Opentrons App! This release focuses on a visual redesign of the app that offers more ways to manage protocols even when you're not connected to a robot.

This release also includes updates to the robot operating system, so be sure to update any OT-2s before running protocols with this version of the app.

## New Features

- Updated design: A more polished and modern design, built around the new, always-accessible Protocols, Labware, and Devices sections.
- Protocols section
  - Import multiple protocols and manage them all in one place.
  - In-app protocol analysis lets you import Python and JSON protocol files without connecting to a robot.
  - View deck setup, required hardware, and protocol metadata â€” before, during, or after a run.
- Labware section
  - Browse labware definitions from the Opentrons Labware Library right in the app.
  - Import custom labware and manage it alongside standard labware.
- Devices section
  - New view for currently available and recently connected robots.
  - See recently run protocols on a robot, including those run from other computers.
  - Run a protocol directly from the robot details page.
  - Easily change a robot's name from the new robot settings page.

## Improved features

- Labware Position Check
  - When re-running a protocol, the app will now automatically recommend stored Labware Offset data (from the last 20 runs on that robot) that applies to the same labware and deck slot.
  - When running Labware Position Check, you will see live offset values as you jog the pipette.

## Opentrons App Changes in 5.0.2

Welcome to the v5.0.2 release of the Opentrons App!

The 5.0.2 release reshapes the way you upload and set up protocols to run on your OT-2. Read below to find out about the new features in 5.0.0.

### New Features

- A completely revamped protocol upload experience that will walk you through setting up your OT-2 for the run
- A new way to check the positioning of your labware prior to a run, where you can apply offsets to each labware individually
- More visibility into the progress of protocol execution on the robot
- Quick and easy re-running of your last used protocol

### 5.0.1 to 5.0.2

The 5.0.2 hotfix release fixes three issues:

1. If you use `load_labware_from_definition` in your Python protocol, you are now able to use Labware Position Check.
2. User-defined labware labels, if present, are now displayed in "Labware Setup"
3. Certain types of protocol upload failures will now show an error message instead of silently failing.

### 5.0.0 to 5.0.1

The 5.0.1 hotfix release contains a small fix to the Labware Position Check to appropriately handle protocols that load pipettes, but never pick up tips with that pipette.

### Known Issues

- Your last run protocol will not be saved through robot reboots
- When you load multiple instances of the same module type in a protocol, the USB port numbers shown in "Module Setup" are incorrect.

## Opentrons App Changes in 4.7.0

The 4.7.0 release is primarily focused on bug fixes on the robot software side. You shouldn't notice any big changes with this upgrade.

### New Features

None in the Opentrons App.

### Bug Fixes

None in the Opentrons App.

---

## Opentrons App Changes in 4.6.2

The 4.6.2 release is primarily focused on bug fixes on the robot software side and behind the scenes changes in the app for future work. You shouldn't notice any big changes with this upgrade.

### New Features

None in the Opentrons App.

### Bug Fixes

None in the Opentrons App.

#### 4.6.1 to 4.6.2

The 4.6.2 hotfix release contains a small bug fix for an issue where the OT-2's max speed settings within a protocol will be ignored. It does not affect the software running in the Opentrons App.

#### 4.6.0 to 4.6.1

The 4.6.1 hotfix release contains a small configuration change to fix an issue with installing the `opentrons` PyPI package on computers running Python 3.8 and later. It does not affect the software running in the Opentrons App.

## Opentrons App Changes in 4.5.0

This release of the app is focused on quality of life improvements as we continue large behind-the-scenes improvements.

### New Features

- Protocol uploads have been made substantially faster! (See OT-2 release notes for more details.)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed issues with the run timer reading `00:00` in the middle of a paused protocol ([#7740][])

## Opentrons App Changes in 4.4.0

This is a quiet release on the app front as we make some behind-the-scenes improvements to how the app is built, so we don't have any changes to report here. There are changes to the OT-2 software, though, so make sure you update your app so it can get your robot fully up to date!

## Opentrons App Changes in 4.3.1

We've improved module functionality with Opentrons App 4.3.0. The app now supports protocols with two Temperature Modules or two Magnetic Modules for Python API Protocols. All connected modules display their USB port connection (including limited USB port information for hubs). We've also updated how modules are displayed on the Run tab.

### New Features

- Support for 2 Temperature Modules or 2 Magnetic Modules
- The USB port to which each module is attached is now displayed in the protocol info screen

### Bug Fixes

- Fix an issue where robots would sometimes not reappear after an update when connected via USB ([#7608](https://github.com/Opentrons/opentrons/issues/7608))

---

## Opentrons App Changes in 4.2.1

### Changes

- There are no app side changes to this release.

---

## Opentrons App Changes in 4.2.0

### Changes

- Do not automatically resume when the user decides not to confirm cancelling a protocol
  - If you click the "cancel" button and then click "Go back", the protocol will be paused until you click resume.

### Bug Fixes

- Fix several issues that prevented changing the settings of an attached pipette.
- You will now be asked whether you have a calibration block in pre-protocol tip length calibration if you have not saved your answer.

---

## Opentrons App Changes in 4.1.1

There are no changes to the Opentrons App in 4.1.1; it is a bugfix release for an issue with installing Python packages on the OT-2.

---

## Opentrons App Changes in 4.1.0

Opentrons App 4.1.0 brings some new features to robot calibration.

### OT-2 Calibration Changes

- You can now choose any standard or custom tiprack of appropriate volume to use when calibrating your pipette
- You can now jog in Z when calibrating to deck markings
- Downloading robot logs will now download a third file which contains logs from the robot's web server

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue that prevented calibration of labware in slots 10 and 11 while using a single channel pipette ([#6886](https://github.com/opentrons/opentrons/issues/6886))
- Protocol upload should be much faster

## Opentrons App Changes in 4.0.0

Opentrons App 4.0.0 is a major software release, bringing an entirely overhauled robot calibration process for the OT-2; a full switch to Opentrons Protocol API Version 2; and many look and feel improvements.

**After you install this update, you must calibrate your OT-2's pipette offsets and tip lengths before running a protocol**. This will take approximately fifteen minutes, but you will not be able to run a protocol until your OT-2 is calibrated.

### OT-2 Calibration Changes

In Opentrons App and Robot Software 4.0.0, the calibration process for the OT-2 is different and improved from major version 3. With these changes, you'll calibrate less often; the calibration processes are shorter, easier, and more reliable; and you can finally use different kinds of tips on the same pipette in the same protocol accurately.

For more in-depth information on the changes, [click here](https://support.opentrons.com/en/articles/3499692-how-calibration-works-on-the-ot-2).

### Full Use of Python Protocol API Version 2

We released Python Protocol API Version 2 almost a year ago, and have been continuously improving it since, with 8 new intermediate API levels, each containing bugfixes, improvements, or support for new hardware. It's ready to be the only way Python protocols are written for the OT-2. Accordingly, in 4.0.0 and subsequent releases, **the OT-2 will not accept Python Protocol API Version 1 protocols**.

### Look and Feel Changes

In 4.0.0, the Opentrons App has some major changes to the Robots tab and the Pipettes & Modules page. These changes present information about the new calibration data more concisely in a better-organized way. We hope you like it!
